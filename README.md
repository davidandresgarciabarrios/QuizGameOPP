# Quiz Game

The **Quiz App** takes a set of predefined questions and answers, processes them into a quiz format, and prompts the user to answer each question while keeping track of their score. It's a simple yet powerful example of how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be used to build an interactive application.
