Quiz Game
The Quiz App takes a set of predefined questions and answers, processes them into a quiz format, and prompts the user to answer each question while keeping track of their score. It's a simple yet powerful example of how OOP can be used to build an interactive application.

Features
Dynamic Question Handling: Questions are dynamically loaded and processed.
User Interaction: The app interacts with the user, prompting for answers and providing immediate feedback.
Score Tracking: The user's score is tracked and displayed at the end of the quiz.
Modular Design: The app is built with a modular design, making it easy to extend and modify.

Usage
Once the application is running, you will be prompted with a series of questions. Simply type 'True' or 'False' to answer each question. At the end of the quiz, your total score will be displayed.
